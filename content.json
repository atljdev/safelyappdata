Even your stomach lining replaces itself every 3 to 4 days. If your body didn't do this, the strong acids used by your stomach to digest food would also digest your stomach! And speaking of your stomach, did you know that your stomach acids are so strong that they can dissolve razor blades?"

Think of how you feel when you smell a flower that used to grow in your grandmother's garden, or the shaving cream your father used when you were a child. Researchers have found that brain waves connect smells through memories via an associative process that links neural networks through synchronized brain waves of 20-40 Hz. The result? Smell is the strongest memory retainer."

The human brain is larger and smarter than that of chimps and gorillas because, although we all have the same genes in the same brain region, these genes are expressed in different \"volumes\" or amounts. It is these differences that affect brain development and function."
